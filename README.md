## What's up Languapps?

We'll reach you with posts here if you're interested in helping with the site. ATM it's just me, [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Nostrathomas0/blog.md) to maintain and preview the content for our website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
